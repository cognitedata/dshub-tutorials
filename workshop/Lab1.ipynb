If you don't have access, you can get access to our `publicdata` project at https://openindustrialdata.com, but note that you will not be able to create assets in that project. It is recommended that you have write access when doing this tutorial. If you don't have your own project, you can apply for one [here](https://cognitedata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSF/pages/1113523070/Creating+a+new+tenant). It takes typically a day or two to create your project."

# Cognite Jupyter Notebook workshop
This is a self-paced workshop where you will learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks to provide value on top of CDF. It does not focus on **why** you would things, but rather **how**, so that you have a place to go when you want to e.g. create an asset hierarchy. The workshop consists of 6 parts.

In this workshop, you begin by getting access to CDF (that means getting an API key to a project / tenant), before you learn how to create and retrieve assets. You will then create timeseries, populate them with data points and plot the data. We then move on to a more advanced tutorial where you
 we load an asset hierarchy from a `csv` file and use that to create the asset hierarchy in CDF. In part 4, you will load time series data from a `csv` file to populate time series.

# Tutorial overview
## [Lab 1 - getting started](./Lab1.ipynb)
In this turorial, you will get started with the Cognite SDK and create your first asset.

## Lab 2 - time series and data points (coming soon)
In this turorial, you will create time series, populate them with data points and plot the data.

## Lab 3 - create data from data files (coming soon)
In this turorial, you will load data from `csv` files and create assets, time series and data points from these files.

## Lab 4 - upload files (coming soon)
In this turorial, you will learn how to upload files and link them to assets.

## Lab 5 - data sets (coming later)
In this turorial, you will learn how to create data sets and tie them to assets and time series.
